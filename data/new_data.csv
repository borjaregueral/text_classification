"I'm happy with the sweater. while one reviewer reports returning it for being too small, i agree with another who found the sweater- especially the arms- too roomy."
"This dress is stretchy and soft, a great length, and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body, but it certain flattered mine."
"When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she's right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash, it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person, just fyi."
"I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly! it's gorgeous in person, and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer."
I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit
"This dress fits so perfectly.  just the right amount of skin, not too bare, not too short, not too long.  can't wait to wear it.  great quality."
"I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5""10, 155lbs. i sent it back."
"Lovely, airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online. i am 5'3"" and 118lb. i ordered a regular s, and it fits fine. yes, it is midi length, coming to about 3"" below my knee. i would have preferred the 39"" length if it had been available, but it was not. still, i will compensate by wearing higher heels :-) the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic, and really makes this dress special. the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication. if you want to a"
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
"The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure."
"I had this in my cart for ages, waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general. i am delighted as it did finally go on sale, i bought it, and it is fabulous!!! my measurements are 36/28/39, i wear a 34d bra, and the small fit perfectly. the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about 3/8"" at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress. what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling, but the lining does not, hence the showing. i"
Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!
"This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. 
i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s"
I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.
"I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same, not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted, generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom, peplum""ish"" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
"I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-) 
te blue is a light blue, almost neutral, with the white embroidery, i think it looked stylish, and decided to keep it. the peplum part hit just in the right spot, i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size..."
"I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition, the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues, i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k"
"I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric, which is soft, lightweight, and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun, and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width, for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes, but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough, and the shirt hits me just at the hip, not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a"
"Love this top, wore it for the first time today and it looks so good. soooo flattering from the front. the back is plain, but ive got some back fat, so i wear a jacket."
"Lush eye catching print. saw it, tried it on and had to have it, full price or not. very comfortable. bought one size down and it fit perfectly."
"...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print, colors, and design. however, i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it, the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good."
"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit"
"I adore this dress.
the fabrics are elegant and unique and combine for a stunning look!
tried with a belt and looks wonderful with or without......so many options.
perfect dress for warm autumn days!
ordered my usual size and fits very true to size.
a must have!"
"Loved this dress online, but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie."
"Color, fabric blend, and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately, i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso, or like the short look, i would recommend this!"
"These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8"" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i didn't get two pair."
This sweater is really pretty. i love the way it looks on but it is a bit itchy and scratch if you don't wear something under it.
"This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap."
I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size
Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better
"I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference."
"This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down"
This top is easy with nice hem detail.
"This dress is so lovely in person, with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall.  the overall cut of the dress is really flattering, especially for hourglass/ pear figures.  sadly, i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small.  i after putting the dress on, i was worried i wouldn't be able to actually get it off.  if you have teeny, tiny arms...you'll probably be okay with your regular size.  if you have any kind of muscle (or squish :)), size up."
"This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest."
I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's
"This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it's fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7"" 135 with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it's loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w"
"I disagree with the most recent review! they are legging style fit but not leggings at all! they are a jean style with a patterning on them a texture.
great colors!"
"Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft, stretchy and has a good quality heft to it."
This tee has a loose fit. very comfortable. covers my backside with inches to spare. flattering fit although oversized. i'm a small-medium in most retailer tops. the small fit me nicely. 34dd 140lbs 5'6. bought it in olive and mustard. great for layering or weekends.
"This picture does not due this sweater justice, at all! i purchased this today for summer. it's beyond cute and the colors are awesome! it's a very light sweater with a fitted (but not too tight) light feel. the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length, at least on me. it looks amazing with white pants, very fresh!!"
"I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!"
"The other reviews stated this was a shapeless top, but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute! the green is a bright, gorgeous jewel tone. it has an overall flowy, bohemian look to it.......the bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho! overall, i am very pleased with this top... it will be a great transitional piece into fall!"
"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
"This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination. and when i tried it on, i was sold. it's super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage."
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!
"I was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater, but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots, i am sold! it is so soft and full of movement. it has a very unique design. the purple color is gorgeous and inviting. i will enjoy this sweater all winter long!! i am usually a small/medium and the medium fits a bit big, but looks beautiful on. the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal."
I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28, which fits loosely, but comfortably."
"The reviews are accurate that have already been said about the material and size. i usually wear a size 2 and i bought a size 4. it fits perfectly. the blouse is very sheer, but if you wear a neutral colored bra, it should be fine. i like the flow and cut of this blouse"
"The top falls nicely, great quality, the lace is beautiful. however, the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it."
"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting, so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight, but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath, which adds a nice touch.  great length, not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"", 124 lbs, and 32b."
"I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate"
I like dresses with sleeves as those are more appropriate for work for me. this dress is a smooth material and the asymmetrical bottom adds just a little extra something. i got it in my normal size and i do find it looser/not meant to be body hugging again making it work appropriate.
Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!
"I really loved this skirt on the model. i ordered it in my typical 0 and it fit well. the green was adorable, and the buttons are rose gold, which is quite pretty. i did exchange this skirt for a 2, only because the 0 was just too short for me. if the 2 is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist, i will probably keep it. i was surprised by how large the a line felt, but i think i can get used to it. it really is very fun, and very easy to dress up or down. i'm really hoping the bigger si"
"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors, fabric, and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing."
Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible
"The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices, i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it, the cotton just doesn't lay right."
"I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting, flattering and perfect for the season. love them.

the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy, and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend. 

they have a bit of str"
"In that i'm on the busty-side, i thought, ""surely an xl will not be too large."" ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway, so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket."
I wore this dress for my small winter wedding and it was perfect! i thought it ran a little large though because i had to return it 2 times to get the right size! once i got the right size it fit perfectly. i loved the champagne color and shine.
"I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of"
"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi"
"I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture."
"I love this dress! it's super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn't bind anywhere--yet somehow it's still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also, it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots, tights, a long-sleeved black t-shirt, etc.)."
I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
"I was hesitant to buy this dress due to there not being any reviews, but decided to take a chance and order it. it is fabulous!!! great fit, off the shoulder design stays in place, and the dress hits the smallest part of my waist perfectly. the lace detail on the hem and the tassels on the ties are details that sets this dress apart. i wish that it was made in another color, perhaps a solid. you all hit this one out of the park, retailer!!!"
"I ordered this top in the purple color and was pleasantly surprised that it was more of a soft periwinkle. the weave is quite open and sheer which is what i had hoped for. the fit is great and the bottom flows quite flatteringly. overall the sweater is soft and very feminine, but careful, it snags easily."
I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldn't forget about it even though i didn't try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!
This runs large. i usually wear a m so i ordered the m/l. reordering in next size down and hope that helps. i gave it 5 stars because the knit is beautiful and quality looked great.
This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.
"This dress is much prettier in person. the embroidery is very beautiful and the slight sheen to the material gives it a dressier look than i expected. the lines are simple, flattering without clinging or choking. it is a nice versatile dress that can be casual or fit for party."
Totally see through.
"Was very surprised when i opened the package, this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured, but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap."
These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.
"I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater."
"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
"Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.
it fit well. not too short. 
will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots. 
my only complaint. i wish it had pockets."
This is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material. the arms and shoulders/armpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust. it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos. a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip.
"I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does"
"I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short"
"I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:
- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)
- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a ""casual"" top)
i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale"
"Yes, this is a beautiful print and fits perfectly...but it's unlined thin polyester. full price is pretty ludicrous on this one. tts, but might need to size up if you have a larger chest (no stretch). hoping to grab on sale."
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
"I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though."
"These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort, they are a five. but after only two wearings, they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price, i'd be more upset."
"I added this to a stack of try-ons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on. 148 dollars is a little pricey but didn't hesitate it was so beautiful, i am a 32b and normally wear a size 6 and the small fit perfectly. can't wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks!"
"I tried this skirt on in the store, it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it, but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so, i ordered it online, it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store, but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts."
"I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec"
"This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to, but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall."
This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.
"This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!"
"I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1, around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut"
"I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a"
"I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi"
"I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, "" give it a chance"". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi"
"This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7"" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend."
This is beautiful. it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i can't wait to start wearing it.
"This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. 

the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim."
"I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i"
"This fits great. it looks great with jeans or exercise pants. a little lighter weight than i hoped but looks great, hangs well on my body. i bought the white."
"Beautiful detail in the bodice... but i'm either too short or it's a bit too long for me. ;) have not yet decided if i ""can"" keep it. material is elegant, details are beautiful."
"True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return."
I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.
This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.
I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
"I usually find maeve to run tts, but i sized down in this. i am normally a 6p and got an xs regular (to make the length more work-appropriate). i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks - making it look a little maternity-like.

it is very flattering on - drapes nicely. i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots!"
"Love this top, you can really fess up, i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds"
"This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!"
"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments."
It's a great light jacket for early spring. ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt.
I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it. it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties. the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well. the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it. the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included. i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures. i think that the looks are
"This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly."
I was initially attracted to the colors
"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store."
I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.
"Overall this is a great shirt. the material is soft and a little sheer, but not sheer enough to have to wear something underneath. the only negative is that the v sits a little high so i felt like i was constantly pulling the shirt down through out the day."
"Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up."
"Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)"
"I knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online, but i also have a hard time trusting retailer's online photos by their color and angle etc. 

i took a gamble and, for the most part, it paid off. i do like the jacket's unique bohemian gone chic/uptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back. what i don't like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs. i feel like there might be one too many ideas, or they could have been toned"
"Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer), a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift, but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!"
"These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches."
"I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice, but the very first time i put it on, it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem, except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o"
"This dress is gorgeous. i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it, but the cost was a deterrent. when it went on sale, i ordered it immediately. hoping it gets here soon! the fit is wonderful, length perfect, embroidery just beautiful, and quality is excellent. it is versatile, too; easy to dress down with a sweater and boots, and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding. for fit reference, i am 5'8"", 130 lb and ordered size 6 (this was the correct fit in the store). exci"
"Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6."
"I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn, quite obviously, inside out. only after i received the navy shirt, where it is extremely obvious, did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but, because i love the style and the fit, i kept it."
I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
"I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in."
"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least."
"I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!"
"I love the look of this bra, but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it."
I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress. this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style. it is a bit of a man repellar dress.the quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning. i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable. i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring. i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small.
Love these! i call them my work overalls because thats pretty much what they are. the pictures of course don't show it but the sides are cut all the way to the waist band at the beginning of the pant. they were very flattering and quite comfy. these are just something easy to throw on and go to work in. i ordered these in a medium and they fit me perfectly. i do wish the top area was slightly wider to accommodate larger busts.
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.
"In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.

here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed."
"I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes."
"Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green..."
The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
"I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape."
"This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit."
"These are fab as always with pure good printed leggings. bright, beautiful print, great quality fabric, and flattering. goes with lots of color tops too! took my usual size s (4/27 in bottoms) and found them perfect."
This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.
"So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho"
This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.
"Fun , flirty, feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear."
"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail, but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso, and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!

curvy ladies, also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely, the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not, and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
"This runs way big, i'm a size 8, purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape."
"This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable."
I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.
"The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics, but in person i found it femine, pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky, colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy, gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly."
"Love this skirt! very fun and feminine. it is a great fit and i love the layering contrast of stripes. length goes right to below my knees, which is perfect for me! i am petite and curvy."
"I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small, i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly, so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint."
"I received this dress in the mail today, and while it is lovely and the drape is flattering, it will have to go back. i would need it in a xsp as the top is far too large for me, and the dress runs long for a petite."
"Great jeans by pilcro, too short and snug around my knees for keeping though."
"These are really cute. nice fabric. i love the rise...not to low, not too high. but they are going back. i'm a size 4. i got these in a 4. they fit fine in the waist and bum but they are tight around my calves. also, they were more like ""high waters"" on me than cropped so a petite in the length probably would have worked better for me had these fit."
"I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price."
"Saw this in the store in pink....very cool dress but i want black so i'm ordering it. the fabric was almost lace-like & it comes w a slip. it was sort of swingy, and designed to be a-line. loved it. the bell sleeves totally make it."
There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!"
"The color of this t is beautiful and the shimmer is understated. very thin fabric, but should be fine."
"The color of this dress is amazing! even though it's not lined, the fabric looks and feels like silk charmeuse and is so light and comfy on your skin. more of a maxi than a midi on me; i'm considering shortening it. elegant and breezy at the same time - love it!"
"Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent, with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long. 
so comfy you can wear it as a robe!
looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large, which i like in a bulky cardi.
super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price."
"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect."
"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters."
"If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my ""art shirt."" the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great."
"When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going"
I love the versatility of this top. i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down.
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
Love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress. a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall :)
"I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty."
"I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s"
"I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back."
"When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions), the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item."
You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.
"I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality, but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it"
"I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly."
"So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade."
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you"
"In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!"
The material on this dress is gorgeous. so soft! the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots!
"I've worn this twice now. the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect. immediately purchased and never took it off. the second time, wore it to my internship (office) followed by museum and a concert. incredibly versatile. constant compliments. 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34 c, 27/28 waist. meant to be loose, carefree, incredibly modern. does wrinkle after long periods of sitting, but not enough to dislike. the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred"
"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. 

fit is tts."
"Ok ladies, i love the whole idea behind these pants..cargo, corduroy, what!!!!?? and in a cool different navy color, had to have them. i got my usual size but in petite (i'm 5'5.5"" with shorter legs longer torso, usually don't get petite in skinniest, but for some reason did this time) and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings! the waist and boodie are perfect, but the calves, yikes! but you know how when you want something to work so bad....i ordered my usual si"
"I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned."
"I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it."
"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else."
"I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha"
"Lightweight and casual, i picked this jacket up on sale. i usually don't like sale items aggressively priced- there is usually a reason why it was a difficult sell to begin with, but this was a pleasant surprise- as in no surprise! picture depicts color and material well. great throw-on for running errands. clean lines, nice simple detail. only thing that is slightly annoying is that the off-center zipper makes the wider side flap over when not zipped, but this is true with almost any top cut th"
"I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too"
"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots."
I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.
This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.
I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.
"I love the unusual print, but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!"
"I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i didn't want to take it off."
"This shirt runs a little big, i bought it for my niece who usually wears a medium , but the small fit her. she is tall and this was a nice length on her.it's very comfortable and is a a perfect staple to send her off to college with. i paired it with the nouveau belt in silver- as an option for her to wear it with- great buy!
my niece is 5' 11"" with an athletic build."
"This is a very flattering top. i'm pretty flat-chested & this top doesn't look too bad. i love the subtle peplum - it makes it a bit dressy. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs & got the xs."
"I love the style of this dress and the way it lays. looks nice on, just wish it were longer. i normally wear size small but had to return for a medium so that it was long enough."
"Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them."
"This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still"
"I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however, i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale."
"This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric, not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40."
"This dress is beautiful. i love the collar and tie neck detail. i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did (i normally wear a 0 or 2 petite and ordered this in a 4 petite). it fits perfect with a little room...not snug at all, which i like. the description says its a slimmer fit so i'm happy i ordered the size i did. i'm excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe."
"I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5"", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months."
This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.
"I just received these pants and they are really cute. they are casual but i think with a cute top/jacket and heels they can be appropriate for a fun night out or casual date. they are really comfortable but they do stretch so size down for sure. i am 5'5"" and weigh 130 lbs and wear a 4/6 in antho. pants that aren't chino fabric but wear a 28 in designer jeans. i ordered a 26 and can probably wear a 25 when these stretch out. i will keep the 26 but they will be baggy. i ordered the kakhi and the"
"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion."
"I just got this in the mail and wore it for the first time today. it is a beautiful top, the crochet portion of it is very well made and overall the top hangs nicely. the linen though is a little bit rough and scratchy. the lining underneath seems a little delicate and is not stretchy so i felt at moments while sitting that i could have just ripped it with one wrong move. the linen also wrinkles pretty easy in the mid-belly section so there is an ugly line going across, a problem with a lot of l"
"I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed, it's just a really thin material."
"I went to the store specifically to try this dress on, because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit. it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life, but unfortunately i couldn't fill out the top. there was gaping even when i went down to a size 0, even though i mostly wear a 4 and sometimes a 2 in retailer dresses. (the 0 fit me everywhere else, which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra, or for someone with more cup size?"
"This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too."
"I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose."
"This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat."
Just a lovely soft and easy cover piece. the back is so different and interesting.
"It's lightweight, which is perfect for summer officewear when i don't want bare arms. my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer. this shirt is sheer but not as much as most, in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheer-ness. i don't find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly, i've worn it to work with a nude bra, and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour. i went a size up to a small becaus"
"I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away."
Perfect lace tank. i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model. i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts . it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust. it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed. so beautiful!
"Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans."
"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit."
"These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed, with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny, which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim, but went down to a 28 in this style."
"I saw this dress in the catalog and on-line and it looked so lovely on the models. i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small. when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric, it was a bit light in my opinion. it did have an interesting texture, (suede like) so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well. unfortunately it did not, it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me. it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin"
Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather
"Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.

they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh"
"I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color, it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.â â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.â â i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and a 32d.â â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee."
"This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.

also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.

i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not"
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.
I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.
These menswear inspired trouser and beyond cute and comfy. great color and fit. soft interior. dress up with a blazer or go casua with a tee. adorable.
Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.
"This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace."
"I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size"
"Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch. can be dressed up or down. i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi. 5'4"" 135# and the small is perfect."
I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!
"So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring."
"I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't"
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
"I ordered this shirt, aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades, but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top, it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts, though, because it was the right fit, despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean, but it wasn't. it was nice and sof"
Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!
"I'm 5'8"" usually a size 2/xs and i bought this in a petite xs. never would i have imagined i'd want a petite size but i accidentally took it into the fitting room. the shorter length and less billowy effect is much more flattering. that said it still hit just below the knee and is very loose and flowing, but in a good way. :)"
"I got this dress and think it's just great. it's a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it's nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i"
"Cute top, a little less fitted than i was expecting."
"I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well"
This is a fantastic skirt and very flattering. i plan to wear this with boots as shown on the model as well as sandals when it gets warmer. i would say that it does run true to size.
"This was my first dress purchase this year, quite late. i've been disappointed with a lot of polyester/rayon/viscose dresses so far. if it's 100% silk or cotton, it's quite expensive. this dress meets all my tick marks: no synthetic, beautiful pattern, well-made, flattering to the figure. i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me. fits true to my petite sizing. it's a very easy to wear dress, no tugging with straps or a belt. it's slimming and skims the figure properly."
"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"", 115 lbs, and ordered an xs."
"I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats."
"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly, fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8"", 155, 34c, reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter, usually a size 2, could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw, ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty"", little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected."
There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.
"I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes, because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a"
"I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o"
Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it's a 10
I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.
"Love this top--the material is very soft and though this isn't a thick tshirt, it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely. i'm 5'7"", about 130, not busty, and got a small--fits great! the color is more of an off-rose/blush (has more of a brown tint than the photo shows)."
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.
"These are great overalls - cute design but wish they came in petite! the big/straps were a little too big for me, so i had to return, but i probably could have had them tailored."
Very comfortable and looks really good on me. that's very important!
So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.
"Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!"
"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it."
"Skirt fit perfectly, nice construction - hidden zipper, full lining - nicely done. would love to see it in navy or black."
"I really love these jeans! this is my second pair of ags and they're so comfortable. i will say that these jeans are super long! i have long legs and it takes a 3 inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly. if you're short, you can expect to get them hemmed. the high waist is great! size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently!"
"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.
i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon."
"I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly."
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
"Classic and beautiful style. structured material that will always fall just right. looks beautiful and will take you to any occasion - heels or flats, office or dinner party. definitely shows off your shoulders."
"I have been eyeing this top online and initially thought it was very fitted and structured as it appears on the model. upon trying it on at the store, i agree with other reviewers it is a tad boxy. i ended up sizing down to a small and it fits nicely. (5' 8"", 145, usually i take a medium or 6/8 in retailer tops). i can see where this might not work for everyone, but i found it to be a fun take on a classic ""tweedy"" look. i plan to add a pop of color with jewelry or even pair it with the pin"
Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.
"I saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors, pattern, and style. it looks even prettier in person. the material is light and soft. the skirt is fully lined so you don't have to worry about it being see-through. also, the skirt is a good length for me and won't drag on the floor. happy with purchase. recommend."
This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.
"This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back."
"I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes."
"I really love this skirt. when i first tried it on, i felt as if it was too thick and bulky for my frame (i'm very slim), but my mom convinced me to get it. well, mother knows best! i wore it to church with boots and a blouse, and it looked great. i received endless compliments! it's also a modest, yet fashionable length."
"I like that i can wear this over anything, only drawback is that it's short-sleeved so it semi-defeats the purpose of having a cardigan but- it's so pretty i can't return it!"
I looooove these pants. i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer. i tried them on and they make my bootie look great. they are also not see through which i love. i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple! ps. they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after 2 wears.
"I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric, but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back."
This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.
"This is probably my new favorite bathing suit. the colors are a tad different than in the picture, but still really pretty"
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
"This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however, it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly, this is a deal breaker for me."
"I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to"
Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red. i loved the color and needed a back up pair. perfect fabric for year round wear. length is great for my height. love every pair i own. this is my 12th pair. love love them.
"This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom, but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer"
"This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown."
"This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a."
I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.
"This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a"
"Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect, i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!"
Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy
"I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look."
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
"Soft and cozy, the orange is vibrant, the green is more subtle and has gray tones. usually wear a small, bought the xxs ! too full and too sloppy in the xs ad small."
"Love the style and cut of this top, but fabric is quite thin. tts if not a tad on the small side. i'm small busted so my usual medium was fine. undecided if i'm keeping this top or not."
"This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top."
"Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it."
"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either."
"Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket."
